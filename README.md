# Challenge 4: My Personal Blog 
This is a webpage that takes inputs on one page and renders blog entries on a seperate page. The second page includes a backbutton, a button that changes light styling, and a link to my github in the footer. Formatting the Javascript to pull and parse an array from local storage was a challengin task. Buttons were the easiest.
